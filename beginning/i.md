# I
a: I really like this article, let's start off with that.

b: You're gonna start with that?

a: Yes.

b: So, you've dug out some shit from 1970 something, that nobody ever cared about, and that's going to be the starting point?

a: Yes. It catches the shift in just a few sentences. Not knowing it does, of course, but that's the point.

b: That couldn't be the point.

a: Why not?

b: Because there's nothing in it. What's the shift?

a: That's what I've been talking about all the time, don't you ever listen?

b: Of course I do, whenever you say something interesting. What's the shift?

a: Overcoming nature.

b: Oh, that.

a: Yes, that.
Listen, he quotes Friedrich Dessauer in 1927 stating that an invention is not simply something made up by the human mind, but rather something the inventor has found. It was actually already there, waiting for its inventor to find it and bring it to our world. And then he dismisses that as bullshit, even making fun of it, not really admitting he is though, just saying he is tempted to, and so doing just that.[^1]

b: Well, it certainly sounds like bullshit to me.

a: Of course it does, we all think it's bullshit now, but it wasn't a hundred years ago, and that's precisely the point.

b: It's become bullshit because we've overcome nature? 

a: Yes. No. Sort of. As a consequence. 

b: You've already lost me.

a: Good, then I've won. You owe me a beer.

b: What do you mean, you've won? We haven't made a bet and this is no competition.

a: But you could buy me a beer?

b: Well, alright.
