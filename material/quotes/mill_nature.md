# John Stuart Mill - Nature

Posthumously published 1874. Finished in 1854 according to James Eli Adams.[^AdamsForgetfulness1] TODO: find a citable edition.

> The united powers of the whole human race couldn't create a new property of matter in general, or of any specific kind of matter. All we can do is to use for our own purposes the properties that we *find*. A ship floats by the same laws of specific gravity and equilibrium as a tree floats after being uprooted by the wind and blown into the water.[^MillNature2]

Here he speaks of the impossibility of our changing nature in the sense of natural laws, nature as "the way in which - i.e. the laws according to which - everything happens:"[^MillNature3]

Shortly afterwards he introduces an additional (aristotelian) meaning of nature:
> So it seems that we have to recognize at least two principal meanings of 'nature'. In one sense, it means all the powers existing in the outer and the inner world and everything that happens by means of those powers. In another sense, it means (not everything that happens, but merely) everything that happens without the agency, or without the voluntary and intentional agency, of man.[^MillNature4]

And he continues:
> Those being the two principal sense of 'nature', let us ask: when it is used to convey ideas of commendation, approval, and even moral obligation, is it being used in either of those senses? and if so, in which?[^MillNature5]

> The claim that a way of thinking, feeling, or acting is 'according to Nature' is usually accepted as a strong argument for its goodness.[^MillNature6]

> My purpose in this Essay is to examine this notion. I shall inquire into the truth of the doctrines that make Nature a test of right and wrong, good and evil, or that in any way and to any degree attach merit or approval to following, imitating or obeying Nature.[^MillNature7] 

> According to Bacon's maxim, we can obey Nature in a way that lets us command it. Every alteration in our circumstances makes some difference, big or small, to *which* laws of Nature we act under: and every choice we make either of ends or of means puts us to a greater or lesser extent under one set of laws of Nature instead of another. So of the useless injunction 'Follow Nature!' were replaced by this: 'Study Nature! Know and pay attention to the properties of the things you have to deal with, insofar as these properties can help of hinder you in achieving your purpose', we would have arrived at the first principle of all intelligent action, or rather at the definition of *intelligent action* itself.[^MillNature8]

> ... while human action can't help conforming to 'Nature' in one meaning of the word, what human action is *for* is to alter and improve 'Nature' in the other meaning. If the natural course of things were perfectly right and satisfactory, to act at all would be pointless meddling that couldn't make things better and would therefore be bound to make them worse. ... to do anything with forethought and purpose would be a violation of that perfect order. If the artificial is not better than the natural, what's the point of human skills? To dig, to plough, to build, to wear clothes, are direct infringements of the injunction to follow Nature.[^MillNature9]

"... the ways of Nature are to be conquered, not obeyed;"[^MillNature10]

> It is an undeniable fact that the order of Nature, when not modified by man, is something that no just and benevolent Being would have made with the intention that his rational creatures should follow it as an example;[^MillNature11]

> This brief survey is quite enough to show that the duty of man is the same with regard to his own nature as it is with regard to everything else - namely not to follow but to amend it.[^MillNature12] 
> 
> Conformity to Nature has no connection whatever with right and wrong. It is never appropriate to bring the idea of *nature* into an ethical discussion except - in a minor role on a few occasions - when the discussion concerns degrees of guilt.[^MillNature13]

> ... all human action whatever consists in altering the spontaneous course of Nature, and all *useful* action consist in *improving* it.[^MillNature14]

In a letter to his wife on 30 December 1854, he wrote:
>I have been reading of a great and rapidly extending disease among silkworms, propagated by the eggs - it seems as if there was a conspiracy among the powers of nature to thwart human industry - if it once reaches the real necessaries of life the human race may starve. The potato disease was a specimen and that was but one root: if it should reach corn? I think that should be a signal for the universal & simultaneous suicide of the human race, suggested by Novalis.[^AdamsForgetgulness2]
