a: John Stuart Mills Essay "Nature", published posthumously in 1874, although written in 1854.[^AdamsForgetfulness1]

b: What do you want with it?

a: Well, first of all I'm simply intereseted in his view on nature. I'm not necessarily concerned with his explicit argument, but with the notions that come to light in what he writes. Secondly, I hope to bring a bit of contrast to the very sketchy, metaphysical views presented in the beginning. Surely, dependence on nature must not always imply metaphysical views on human actions. 

b: So what have you got?

a: It's pretty complex. Basically, the essay is an argument against nature and the natural forming some sort of ethical norm. He's forming a case against a, according to his own account, generally spread conception of nature as a model for goodness. Exactly who he's arguing against, he doesn't really say. The name of Rousseau passes by, but he's not citing him. Instead, he means that "The claim that a way of thinking, feeling, or acting is 'according to Nature' is usually accepted as a strong argument for its goodness."[^MillNature6] And:
> My purpose in this Essay is to examine this notion. I shall inquire into the truth of the doctrines that make Nature a test of right and wrong, good and evil, or that in any way and to any degree attach merit or approval to following, imitating or obeying Nature.[^MillNature7] 

And his conclusion is very clear:

> Conformity to Nature has no connection whatever with right and wrong. It is never appropriate to bring the idea of *nature* into an ethical discussion except - in a minor role on a few occasions - when the discussion concerns degrees of guilt.[^MillNature13]

More interesting to me is how he argues and which concept or concepts of nature he uses. In the beginning of the essay, he states the need to distinguish between two concepts of nature:

> So it seems that we have to recognize at least two principal meanings of 'nature'. In one sense, it means all the powers existing in the outer and the inner world and everything that happens by means of those powers. In another sense, it means (not everything that happens, but merely) everything that happens without the agency, or without the voluntary and intentional agency, of man.[^MillNature4]

The second one of course being the aristotelian concept of nature. The first can basically be understood as natural laws - *Naturgesetze*. What interests me, is first of all what he says using the first meaning of nature:

> The united powers of the whole human race couldn't create a new property of matter in general, or of any specific kind of matter. All we can do is to use for our own purposes the properties that we *find*. A ship floats by the same laws of specific gravity and equilibrium as a tree floats after being uprooted by the wind and blown into the water.[^MillNature2]

He's making it very clear that natural laws are natural laws, and that there is nothing whatsoever we could do to change them. We can only use them. We can study them in order to understand what we have to deal with, to be able to control what we can control.[^MillNature8] Secondly, he means that 

> ... while human action can't help conforming to 'Nature' in one meaning of the word, what human action is *for* is to alter and improve 'Nature' in the other meaning.... If the artificial is not better than the natural, what's the point of human skills? To dig, to plough, to build, to wear clothes, are direct infringements of the injunction to follow Nature.[^MillNature9] 

This is very far away from the metaphysical views of invention we encountered in the beginning. Here is no talk about human beings not being able to invent anything that isn't already there. On the contrary, the while point in our doing anything at all, is to do things that would otherwise not be - "all human action whatever consists in altering the spontaneous course of Nature, and all *useful* action consist in *improving* it."[^MillNature14]

So on the one hand, we have a contrast to the very briefly outlined metaphysical views that may be found in the beginning of the 20th century. We should definitely not think that everybody thought like Dessauer before the shift. On the other hand, the way he talks about nature in the first sence, that "the united powers of the whole human race couldn't create a new property of matter in general, or of any specific kind of matter"[^MillNature22] - I don't think anybody would state it like that today. Here, the dependence of nature is made very clear. Certainly, he means we should do all we can to improve nature, but a notion of indepencence of nature is very distant.

One might add, putting a little bit of context on the essay, that at the time of its writing, Mill's wife was seriously ill in a decease the medicine of the time was relatively powerless against, [^AdamsForgetgulness2] thus underlining the dependence on nature in a most brutal way. But actually, I'm  not sure this sort of contextualization really makes sense. Does it change our understanding of the original text? I suppose, but should it? Does it make it better or just different?

Aren't you goint to say something sarcastic?

b: Do I have to?

a: No.
