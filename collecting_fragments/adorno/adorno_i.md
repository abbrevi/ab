a: I don't know how to begin this so I'll just start.
> Jeder Versuch, den Naturzwang zu brechen, indem Natur gebrochen wird, gerät nur um so tiefer in den Naturzwang hinein. So ist die Bahn der europäischen Zivilisation verlaufen.[^DA1]

a: This is sort of the essential core of Adornos and Horkheimers *Dialektik der Aufklärung*, and it is simply very intriguing. If we for starters compare it with the quotes from Ropohl at the beginning, where he e.g. means that the ecological movement only "auf die fortschreitende Technisierung der Natur hinausläuft"[^Rophol1], it at the first glance seems Adorno and Horkheimer are saying quite the opposite. At a second glance, you might think they are basically saying the same thing, just in different words, and at a third, that you can't really compare it, since they are using an entirely different concept of nature.

b: Are they?

a: Thank you, that is precisely the question. What is the concept of nature behind the argument of Adorno and Horkheimer? What is meant by *Naturzwang*, and how could any "braking" of nature lead to even deeper *Naturzwang*?

b: Well, it's a fair question.

a: I'll formulate it a bit better as I go along. I hope. Right now, I just have a first hypothesis. When Adorno and Horkheimer are writing about nature here, it is not at all in an Aristotelian sense of "what exists in itself independent of mankind". In fact, the way they discuss nature, it is all human-made. Nature is used for *das Gegenüber*, for what we have to fight against to gain freedom, whatever it is. In that respect, to get control of anything "nature", we need to develop technologies and systems, which in turn in themselves become part of *das Gegenüber*, i.e. of nature in the sense they write about it. 

b: Interesting hypothesis. Do you have anything to back it up?

a: Eh, no.

b: And you are of course aware, that you could never understand Adorno without Marx, or Marx without Hegel, or Hegel without Kant ...

a: Sure, this will be very interesting.
