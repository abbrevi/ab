b: What you have is one person manifesting his point of view, partly by putting it in opposition to the opinions of others, whom he obviously disagrees with. And basically, he's just using them to make his own point. He's not even trying to understand Dessauer. There is no reflection whatsoever on the context in which Dessauer wrote what he wrote. To whom was he talking? Was he responding to someone? What was his position? Did he somehow try to manifest this position in what he wrote? What might he have had to gain, to accomplish by putting things the way he did? Without even reflecting upon things like that, there is no way to form some sort of understanding of what he was saying. The meaning of an utterance can never be found in an isolated quote.

a: I give you the right, but I don't get your point.

b: There will always be different opinions. You will always be able to find people with different points of view, some of them ridiculing the notions of others to allegedly support their own. That doesn't mean there is some sort of shift.

a: No, of course not. I didn't mean it as an argument. By the way, if you want some context on Dessauers standpoint, I do recommend Hans-Liudger Dienels *Herrschaft über die Natur? Naturvorstellungen deutscher Ingenieure 1871-1914*.[^1] It's an excellent book. But we shouldn't go into that now, since this is about something else. I'm just using Ropohl's article as an illustration. Writing in 1980, his standpoint is fundamentally different from the ones of Dessauer, Bloch and Heidegger, which were basically formed in the 1920s. 

b: The writings of Bloch and Heidegger, that Ropohl refers to, are from 1959 and 1962, respectively. 

a: True, although Bloch's *Das Prinzip Hoffnung* was written in American exile during the Second World War, only not published until 1959. But it's not so much a question of when the texts were written. It's much more a question of generations. Dessauer, Bloch and Heidegger were all born in the 1880s, Dessauer in 1881, Bloch in 1885, and Heidegger in 1889. Ropohl, an engineer and philosopher of technology himself, just like Dessauer, was born in 1939. The fundamental difference is that to Ropohl, human actions, or at least inventions, are completely independent of nature, in fact immanently opposing nature, as to the representatives of an older generation they are always is some form dependent on nature. This is an illustration of the shift, of that in the decades following the Second World War, mainly the 1950s and 1960s, we have overcome nature.

b: You do need to explain what you mean a bit more extensively.

a: Sure.
