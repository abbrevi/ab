b: I suppose, you don't really have a plan.

a: You're absolutely right, I don't. But of course, we could start outlining some of the possible themes.

b: We?

a: Well, you are part of this, obviously.

b: I was afraid you might say that.

a: And I did. One of the more interesting tasks is to establish the connection between relationship to / notions of nature and metaphysical concepts of truth, morals, beauty, etc.

b: How?

a: Through the concept of organicity, to start with, in social theory and the arts. And you could probably connect that with the metaphysical views of Dessauer and other engineers in his time.

b: But you wouldn't find any metaphysical concepts of truth as natural in the sense of *naturgegeben* in that, would you?

a: Probably not, we'll see. Speaking of that, what happens with things considered *naturgegeben* when we have overcome nature? Do they survive, do they change, do they lose importance, or what? What about something like *Naturrecht*, which has had a fundamental impact on the concept of human rights?

b: Interesting question. But even if you find that these things have changed fundamentally, it doesn't mean that had anything to do with our "overcoming nature" as you put it. Everything changes all the time, for a great number of reasons. And you still have to establish, that we really have overcome nature in the sense you mean, that this "shift" of yours has actually happened.

a: True, that will be a interesting chapter. And by the way, what happens to the natural sciences when our relationship to nature fundamentally changes? Are they about something entirely different today than a hundred years ago?

b: Another vast question, that it would take years to answer partially. Nice. I think you have enough themes for starters.

a: Definitely.
